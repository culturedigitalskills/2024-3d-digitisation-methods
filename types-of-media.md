- This section looks at media types representing material culture information.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Multidimensional** media is a term which 
covers various types of non-textual data.
It is often used to refer to 
representational and derivative media created through
digitisation processes or synthetic 
images produced via software. These processes often result in multi-part,
multi-format and, often, large 
project files which describe the creation process. 


We refer to media as **multidimensional**. 
This is because data experts structure information
according to the **dimensions** used to store the data
in the computer system. 

For example, the **name** of one of your friends can
be stored in a data type with **1-dimension**:

```
John Smith
```

Meanwhile, a table which stores the name of all your friends
and their addresses will use a data type similar to 
a spreadsheet table. 

```
| Name            | Address         |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| John Smith      | 34 Street Rd    |
| Marion Lopes    | 105 Babel St    |

```

The latter uses **2-dimensions**
as both rows and columns are used to organised
the data. 

## Digital Images
Data in digital images is organised similar to tables, 
as *pixels*
or *picture elements*, which are the smallest element 
of an image, are organised across **2-dimensions**.
We usually refer to these dimensions as the *x*, *y* axis.

![Example of pixels. &copy; ed g2s from Wikimedia Commons](fig/pixel-example.png){alt="pixels"}

The **image resolution** usually refers to how many 
*pixels* an image has, either as a total or its width. 
This is why *resolution* is usually given
in *2-dimensions*, for example an image with a resolution of
*800 × 600 pixels* will have *800 pixels* across the x-axis
(its width),
and *600 pixels* across the y-axis (its height). The image will contain  *480,000 pixels* in total.

Meanwhile, the **PPI** or **DPI** (**Pixels per Inch** or **Dots Per Inch**) 
attributes of images refer
to their pixel density. That is how many pixels there are in 
1 inch (2.54 cm) in the display in which the image
is *rendered* or in the printed image. 

![Resolution screen pixel density &copy; brovarky from AdbobeStock ](fig/AdobeStock_136018032.jpeg){alt="DPI example"}

Example of digital images include digital photographs generated
by a camera sensor (e.g. on a smart phone), or synthetic
images created on directly on the computer (e.g. painting tools or generated
by Artificial Intelligence software).

![Top) Digital photographs &copy; Leonid Tit from AdobeStock, bottom) Computer generated image &copy; irissca from AdobeStock](fig/AdobeStock_635196929.jpeg){alt="generated"}

Given the wide-availability of camera sensors, including
on smart phones and digital cameras,
digital images are the widest available multidimensional media.

### Image Platforms
Collections of images are found across many websites, and popular search engines
now support image-based search which allows to search digital-images
across websites giving an input image. See examples:

- [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/)
- [Adobe Stock](https://stock.adobe.com/)
- [Shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/)
- [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge: Search for images

Save the image below and navigate in your browser to [https://www.google.com/](https://www.google.com/).
Using the camera image on the search bar, search for the image.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Image Formats

Finally, images are commonly stored using formats such such as:

- *JPEG*, short for Joint Photographic Experts Group, and *PNG*, short for
Portable Network Graphics formats compress
pixel information making the files size smaller.
- *TIFF*, short for *Tag Image File Format*, 
stores non-compressed information, making the file size larger.

Digital photography will make use
of other formats, such as *DNG* or *RAW* to store raw image information. 
Other software store image projects in proprietary formats, meaning files
can only be open by these.



## Digital Video

Digital video could be considered a **2-dimensional** or, even a **3-dimensional**,
type of media.

This is because a video contains many images or **frames**, which are stored
in **2-dimensions** as described above, and rendered sequentially.

![Frames on a video film &copy; ismailbasdas from Adobe Stock](fig/AdobeStock_598901894.png){alt="frames in video"}
![Jump sequence motion in 8 frames &copy; Vector Tradition from Adobe Stock](fig/AdobeStock_603342595.jpeg){alt="frames in video frog"}


Videos also have a **Resolution** which is related to the images.
The resolution will be the same for all the frames in a video file.
For instance, a 4K video is usually made of frames which are
X x Y in resolution.

The rate at which frames are displayed is usually referred
to as **Frames Per Second** or **FPS**. For reference,
TV and movies are usually displayed at 24 FPS.

### Video Platforms
Video is also a popular type of content, as there are many other platforms
on the web which allow
users to easily share their media. See examples:

- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com)
- [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/)
- [Wikimedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Videos)


Note that while images can be downloaded by web browsers, 
it is not always possible to download video 
from these websites. Many times, video is only made available
through a media player.

### Video Formats
There are many formats to store video and audio, including
those supported by webpages:

- MP4 (MPEG-4) is a common *container format* which can play
in almost all devices and over the web.
- WebM and OGG are open video formats.

There are many others [formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_file_format).

Note that videos with higher resolution and FPS will 
be larger and hence, challenging 
to send via email or download over the web. 

## 3D Images or Models
A **3D model** is a 3-dimensional type of media. It 
describes 3D shapes along with other information related to their 
appearance, e.g. colour information. 

To understand how **3D models** are described
and displayed in the computer, we need to understand two concepts:
**vector** and **raster** data.


There are resources here to learn more about processes for **3D model** production:

- [CARARE Introduction to the 3D workflow](https://carare.gitbook.io/share-3d-guidelines/3d-process/context)
- [Photogrammetry](https://sketchfab.com/blogs/community/how-to-set-up-a-successful-photogrammetry-project)
- [Basic principles and tips for 3D digitisation of cultural heritage
](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/basic-principles-and-tips-3d-digitisation-cultural-heritage)

### Vector Data
Regardless of the process, the output of these processes, 
in most cases will produce a **3D model** file which 
contains **vector** data. 

<!--
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

This exercise requires having access to blank paper and a square-grid paper.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge 1: Drawing a 3D-cube

In a piece of blank paper, draw a 3-dimensional cube or box of dimensions:

height = 1 

width = 1  

depth = 1

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

To describe a 3D cube, the file will contain
data describing the 6 squares using 
point coordinates (e.g. (1,0,0)).

![](fig/cube.png){alt='cube vector format'width=60%}


In the example below, a squareis described
using 4 points or *vertices*: (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (1,1,0) and (0,1,0).


![](fig/square.svg){alt='square vector format'width=60%}

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Challenge 2: Draw it again

Now, using a square-grid paper draw again your cube or box using the 
same dimensions. In this exercise you must decide whether to fill or
not the squares of the grid to draw your 3-dimensional box.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

You have just experienced the concept of **Rasterisation**. 

This challenge illustrates the decision made by the computer
on what information to display on the screen. It must decide
whether a pixel should be drawn or not to represent the 
information of the 3D-cube you drawn.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

-->
These data include:

- Points or vertices described in a 3D space.
- Information on how the points are connected to form
shapes such as triangles, which is known as the topology
or connectivity of the 3D model.
- Colour or texture (image) information which describe its appearance. 

### Raster Data

**Rasterisation** is the process 
to go from a **vector** description 
into a **raster** image. 

The **raster image** is the pixel-based representation of the
vector description.

![Rasterization process &copy; [Drummyfish](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Top-left_triangle_rasterization_rule.gif) under CC0](fig/Top-left_triangle_rasterization_rule.gif){alt='square raster format' width=60%}


<!--
![](fig/square_raster.svg){alt='square raster format' width=60%}
-->


**3D models** are *rendered*
as raster images on the screen, smartphone or any
other display device (e.g. a Virtual Reality headset).
The computer will have to *compute* this raster
image in real-time, which is why
**3D models** which contain many vertices
can be slow to *render*.


### Examples of 3D models
We tend to use **3D model** to refer to many types of 
spatial data.

For example, see below an example of a 3D model
of an architectural space. 

<!-- Points in space acquired by a sensor device such
as a 3D scanner, or 
- Points calculated by a photogrammetry process, which calculates
spatial data from images of the same object.-->

In many cases, the 3D data can be mostly points in 3D space as
shown below.

Spatial data can also be recorded with an additional
parameter - **time**. 

For instance, motion capture devices will
generate vector data which changes many times within a second.
We call this measure
sampling rate per second.

### 3D Model Platforms

Popular format platforms include:

- [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/)
- [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/)
- [MorphoSource](https://www.morphosource.org/)
- [Kompakkt](https://kompakkt.de/home?locale=en)
- [Smithsonian 3D](https://3d.si.edu/)
- [Open Heritage 3D](https://openheritage3d.org/ )
- [Visual Media Service](https://visual.ariadne-infrastructure.eu/)

As with video, the *viewers* for **3D models** normally allow
to visualise and interact with the information. But these viewers do not always allow to download the model that is viewed.

### 3D Model Formats
There are many file formats for **3D images** or **models** 
including:

- GLTF (JSON/ASCII) or GLB (binary) is the standard 
Graphics Library Transmission Format which is commonly used for **3D models**
on the web.
- OBJ, USD and PLY are popular format for 3D data which support 
additional information, such as textures or colour.
- STL is a popular format in 3D printing and rapid prototyping.

Other proprietary formats such as FBX and 3DS will contain
vector information on scenes.

The number of points/vertices or triangles are used 
to determine the resolution of the 3D model. Note that, 
as with images and video,
**3D models** that have a larger number of vertices, for example,
over 100,000 will have a larger size. This has an impact
on how long it takes to download, load or *render* this content.
 
## Gathering Multidimensional Files

Great variety of multidimensional content is available through
the various platforms for 
research, education, entertainment and storytelling among
other applications. 

Some aggregation websites offer access to a variety of visual 
content, including:

- [Europeana Platform](https://www.europeana.eu/en)
- [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Images)

Other discipline specific or museum sites include:

- [Journal of Digital History Journal](https://journalofdigitalhistory.org/)
- [Brighton and Hove Museums](https://collections.brightonmuseums.org.uk/)
- [Victoria and Albert Museum](https://www.vam.ac.uk/collections?type=featured)
- [Science Group Museum](https://collection.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/)


Some general advice when looking for content
for your projects includes:

1. **Download the multimedia file** where possible and store locally or on the 
repository where you are curating the data set. 
2. Use the **maximum resolution possible**. It is always possible to reduce the number of pixels, but not to increase them.
3. **Record basic metadata** about the file,
including the reference and copyright to the image. 

If you are doing 
additional research look at data models, such as the [Dublin-CORE cross domain set](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/cross-domain-attribute/),
which contains useful information to store, including:

  - Title
  - Subject
  - Description
  - Date
  - Resource Type
  - Format
  - Resource Identifier
  - Language 
  - Rights Management


4. Remember to use a suitable file name to keep easy track of the media and its provenance.
If the file it is too large, it is possible to resize and save again in 
medium and low quality.


For example:

```
		WebsiteFromWhereFileWasDownloaded_ResourceID_[high|medium|low].[format] 
```

This will become:

```
    Flick_photo1234_high.png
    Flick_photo1234_medium.png
    Flick_photo1234_low.png
```
    
### Controlled vocabularies
To facilitate the quality of documentation, findability, access and long-term preservation of data, controlled vocabularies can be also used to help with adding the above-mentioned and further data. Essentially, controlled vocabularies, with their standardised terms and language, describe artefacts, objects, or concepts within a specific domain and help organise and communicate information in databases and information systems. 

Some of the most well-known and used vocabularies in the cultural heritage domain are: 

- [The Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus (AAT)](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/)
- [The Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN)](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/tgn/index.html)
- [The Union List of Artist Names (ULAN)](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/ulan/index.html)
- [The Cultural Objects Name Authority (CONA) (in progress)](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/cona/index.html)
- [The Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH)](https://www.loc.gov/aba/publications/FreeLCSH/freelcsh.html)
- [PeriodO - A gazetteer of periods for linking and visualizing data](https://perio.do/en/)

More vocabularies in the heritage domain exist and serve different purposes. Some further examples from Historic England, Historic Environment Scotland and the Royal Commission on Ancient & Historical Monuments of Wales (RCAHMW) can be found [here](https://www.heritagedata.org/blog/vocabularies-provided/). 

Tools to map vocabularies also exist, such as the [Vocabulary Matching Tool](https://heritagedata.org/vocabularyMatchingTool/) by the University of South Wales and the [Vocabulary Matching Tool](https://vmt.ariadne.d4science.org/vmt/vmt-app.html) by the EU Horizon 2020-funded AriadnePlus project. 

The organisation of terms within controlled vocabularies typically adheres to a taxonomy. Taxonomies categorise or classify vocabularies usually in a hierarchical way. An interesting taxonomy in the field of Digital Humanities is the [TaDiRAH Taxonomy of Digital Research Activities in the Humanities](https://vocabs.dariah.eu/tadirah/en/).

:::::: keypoints

- Digital Images are organized using pixels, the smallest elements of an image, which are arranged across 2 dimensions (x and y axis). 

- Image resolution refers to the number of pixels, and it is usually given in 2 dimensions (e.g., 800 × 600 pixels). 

- Digital Video is a 2-dimensional or even 3-dimensional type of media.

- Videos consist of multiple frames stored in 2 dimensions (like images).

- Videos also have a resolution and frame rate (Frames Per Second).

- 3D Images or Models are files containing vector data describing spatial information. 

- Rasterization is the process of converting vector graphics 
into raster images.

- Various aspects need to be considered when collecting, storing, and managing multimedia files effectively. 

- Recording metadata and using appropriate file naming conventions
is important.
